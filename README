# Bus Tracking Website

This is a bus tracking website designed to provide real-time tracking of buses using the driver's mobile device. Unlike other tracking systems, this platform relies on the driver's mobile location to accurately track the bus's position.

## Features

- Real-time bus location updates
- Location data sourced directly from the driver's mobile device
- User-friendly interface for passengers to view bus locations

## How It Works

1. The driver installs the mobile app and enables location sharing.
2. The app continuously sends the driver's (bus) location to the server.
3. Passengers can view the live location of the bus on the website.

## Note

This project is under development. More features and details will be added soon.
